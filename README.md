## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ethan, an up and coming Data Analyst
I'm a Junior Data Analystin training with hands-on experience in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. I'm passionate about taking something messy and making it into something with value, which perfectly aligns with what a Data Analyst does. Currently, I'm completing the TripleTen BIA/Data Analytics program remotely. I've built projects analyzing Airbnb datasets, streaming services, and product sales. My focus is becoming a better Analyst daily, and the past few months have been amazing within the program.

Skills & Tools:
Languages/Queries - SQL, DAX basics, Python (fundamentals)
Visualization - Tableau, Power BI
Spreadsheets - Excel (Pivot Tables, Functions, Conditional  Formatting)
Other - Data Cleaning, Business Intelligence Concepts

Portfolio Projects:
Tableau Dashboards - Tableau public profile > https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ethan.leake/vizzes < Interactive dashboards published online.

Some things about me:
- I love cheesecake with a burning passion
- I wanted to be a fitness guru when I was a teenager
- In April of 2025 I was involved in a car accident which led me out of manual labor, and into Data Analytics
- I've never been on a plane, but I'm not scared of flying (I don't think?)
- I've loved anime since I was 6 years old
